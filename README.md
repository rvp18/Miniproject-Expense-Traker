User Interface Design:-
User Interface Design is concerned with the dialogue between a user and the computer. It is 
concerned with everything from starting the system or logging into the system to the eventual 
presentation of desired inputs and outputs. The overall flow of screens and messages is called a 
dialogue.
The following steps are guidelines for User Interface Design:
• The system user should always be aware of what to do next.
• The screen should be formatted so that various types of information, instructions, and messages 
always appear in the same general display area.
• Message, instructions, or information should be displayed long enough to allow the system user to 
read them.
• Use display attributes sparingly.
• Default values for fields and answers to be entered by the user should be specified.
• A user should not be allowed to proceed without correcting an error.
• The system user should never get an operating system message or fatal error.
